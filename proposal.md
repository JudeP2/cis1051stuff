# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PowerPong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We plan to implement different types of powerups and debuffs into the pong code based on certain factors. For example, if player 1 gets a point then player 2 could get a powerup such as a bigger paddle that lasts for a couple of seconds or for the entire round.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project is going to allow the user to be able to play pong with various powerups and debuffs. Powerups can vary to having a bigger paddle, to launching the ball at a faster speed. Debuffs would appear if the lead between scores is significant such as 0-5, if thats the case then the player in the lead would recieve a debuff such as slower paddle, or the ball velocity is slower when they hit it to give the other player a chance to hit it back.



## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Zamir Shelton - tuj04181@temple.edu
    TA: Chong Li
Isaac Pointer - tuj92606@temple.edu
    TA: Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-- implementing powerups
-- implementing debuffs

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-- implementing powerups and debuffs that are given to the players due to fair reasons such as being in a significant lead, or being up by 1 or 2 points

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-- implementing as many creative powerups and debuffs we can think of to spice up how the game of pong is played

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In order to be able to implement these things were going to have to dive deep into love and Lua and all the new things we have to learn to get it to function properly. It is slightly different then python but most of the same techniques apply. We should also learn which powerups and debuffs would be fun to play with. Each person in the group is going to create the functions for a set number of powerups/debuffs.
